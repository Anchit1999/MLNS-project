# MLNS-project
Learning molecular dynamics with simple language model built upon long short-term memory neural network

## Description
Given a system, we want to understand the MD trajectory it went through. We also want to learn the kinetic properties of this system.MD simulation technique produces large-size and long-timescale data that are inherently high-dimensional and occupies many terabytes of data. Processing this immense amount of data in a meaningful way is becoming increasingly difficult.
