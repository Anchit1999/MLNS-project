# Description
Single molecule force spectroscopy experiments ofa multi-state riboswitch performed with a constant force of 10.9 pN.
The files contain the sequence of end-to-end extension values measured as a function of time. The sampling is at 10 kHz, so each datapoint is separated by 100 us. 
The trajectory for a wide range of extensions starting 685 nm up to 735 nm was first spatially discretized into 34 labels, and then converted to a timeseries of one hot vectors
