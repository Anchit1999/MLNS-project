# Description
The MD trajectory for alanine dipeptide was obtained using the software GROMACS patched with PLUMED 2.4.The temperature was kept constant at 450K using the velocity rescaling thermostat. Study of
conformational transitions in alanine dipeptide, a model biomolecular system comprising 22 atoms, experiencing thermal fluctuations when coupled to a heat bath. the full system comprises around 63 degrees of freedom, typically the torsional angles φ and ψ are used to identify the conformations of this peptide
